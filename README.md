# data_engineering

Now Folks here is what I did:
0. fetch any changes made on the repo: git pull origin < branch_name >
1. Create a directory git_world in my system and went inside it.
2. did git .init
3. created a file git_readme.md
4. created a repository/repo on online github called data_enineering
5. added the repo as remote host by: git remote add origin 'https://github.com/RebeccaRaezada/data_engineering.git/'
5. create a branch for each topic--> git branch git_best_practices
6. commited the file with a message git commit -m "first commit"
7. pushed the changes to remote host: git push origin git_world
8. fetch any changes made on the repo: git pull origin git_world [ just like this readme contents i'm writing now ]
