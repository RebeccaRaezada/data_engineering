# data_engineering

Now Folks here is what I did:
1. Created a directory git_world in my system and went inside it.
2. git .init
3. created a file git_readme.md
4. commited the file with a message git commit -m "first commit"
5. created a repository on online github called data_enineering
6. added the repo as remote host by: git remote add origin 'https://github.com/RebeccaRaezada/data_engineering.git/'
7. pushed the changes to remote host: git push origin git_world
8. fetched any changes made on the repo: git pull origin git_world [ just like this readme contents im writing now ]
